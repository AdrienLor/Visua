### Changed

- Updated README and documentation to reflect the new scope.

## [1.1.0] – 2025-08-21

### Added
- 🎞 **Slideshow mode** (fullscreen, distraction-free, image A only).  
  - Navigation:  
    - → Arrow / Left Click / Scroll Up → Next image  
    - ← Arrow / Scroll Down → Previous image  
    - Esc / Right Click → Exit slideshow  
  - Toggle with **F11** or 🎞 toolbar button.  
- ⏱ **Automatic slideshow playback** with configurable interval (1–30s).  
- ℹ **About dialog (modal)** with integrated slideshow help and blocked background interactions.  
- 📂 **New folder dialog (modal)** with proper validation and blocked background interactions.  
- Bottom **status bar** for temporary messages (success/error).  

### Changed
- Toolbar and dialogs refined for clarity.  
- Diaporama and About are now **true modal dialogs**: background dimming + no interaction possible behind.  
- Slideshow defaults to fullscreen without window borders.  

### Fixed
- Prevented images from being accidentally re-saved in the parent folder when no subfolder was selected.  
- Window centering logic now applies consistently on startup.  
- Focus handling improved in modal dialogs (no loss of interaction if clicking outside).
